Designing a Webpage
This is my first amazing Webpage design by ALX.
In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.
The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

This is how the final result should look like, hopefully:
